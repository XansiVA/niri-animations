# Niri Animations
A host for Niri Animations configurations to be shared using custom shaders built in with GLSL

> **Notice**
> We don't take animation configs that are not **Custom Shaders!**
This means that they must be written in GLSL or any other graphics programming.

You are allowed to ask for a animation, contribute, and download any of them all you like
Enjoy them!
